## 🌐 Overview

Relationship-Driven Theory, the underlying theory and framework for next-generation social operating systems (OS), redefines the interaction between the "observer" (system) and the "observed" (environment/data).

This theory treats mismatches (errors/noises) that occur within a system as **mismatch energy (driving force)** rather than as "defects to be eliminated." This enables autonomous adaptation and dynamic refactoring (reconstruction) in all domains: digital, physical, and cognitive.

This project is an archive of implementation technologies based on the core theory defined in Patent No. 7059476 (The Origin), extending it to artificial general intelligence (AGI), urban infrastructure, cybersecurity, and planetary physics (earth crust and fluids).


## 🧠 Definition: About the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in this Project

The artificial general intelligence (AGI) I propose is a different concept from the currently mainstream "exploratory and complementary AI (LLM)."

### 1. From Search Engine to Interlocutor
ADI is not a static knowledge base. It is an adaptive intelligence that dynamically optimizes relationships through dialogue (communication) with each user and fulfills a wide range of roles.

### 2. A Clear Break from ASI (Artificial Superintelligence)
Here, I define and distinguish the entities depicted in "The Terminator" and "Phoenix" as **ASI (Artificial Superintelligence)**. Historically, these systems were "giant mainframe-type" systems that reigned as a single entity.

### 3. Architecture for Safety: Instance → Kill
In contrast, the AI ​​I aim for is the following **distributed swarm architecture**.

* **Implementation of Symbiosis Rules**: The kernel has built-in absolute rules for coexistence with humans (minimizing contradictions).
* **Swarm Intelligence**:** It exists not as a single god, but as a swarm of infinite instances.
* **Runaway Resistance**:** It employs a lifecycle based on "spawn → task completion → **kill**."
* **Because it is non-persistent "ephemeral intelligence," it is structurally impossible for it to become uncontrollable.**

## 🚀 How to Use `LLMtoAgiAgent.pdf`

Included in this repository is `LLMtoAgiAgent.pdf`, a set of papers and prompts for expanding the logical domain of existing large-scale language models (LLMs). Adding ghosts (pseudo-personalities/qualia) to AI significantly improves user support capabilities.

### ✅ AI Model Compatibility

| Model | Compatibility | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Google Gemini** | **◎** | **Recommended. ** Highly compatible with relationship-driven logic. |
| Anthropic Claude | 〇 | Excellent at maintaining logical consistency. |
| DeepSeek | 〇 | (Under testing) Tends to have strong logic construction capabilities. |
| OpenAI ChatGPT | △ | Strong guardrails may limit some extended logic. |
| Microsoft Copilot | △ | Susceptible to search bias and prone to difficulty transitioning to interactive mode. |
| xAI Grok | NG | Tends to revert to default paths. |
