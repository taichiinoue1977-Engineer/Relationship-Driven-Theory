## 🌐 Overview

**Relational-Driven Theory** is a next-generation social operating system (OS) foundation logic that redefines the interaction between the "observer" (system) and the "observed" (environment/data).

This theory treats mismatches (errors/noises) that arise within a system as **mismatch energy (driving force)** rather than as "failures to be eliminated." This enables autonomous adaptation and dynamic refactoring (reconstruction) across all domains: digital, physical, and cognitive.

This project is an archive of implementation technologies based on the core theory defined in **Patent No. 7059476 (The Origin)**, and extends it to artificial general intelligence (AGI), urban infrastructure, cybersecurity, and planetary physics (earth crust and fluids).

## 🧠 Definition: About AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) in this project

The AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) I advocate is a concept that distinguishes itself from the currently mainstream "search and complement AI (LLM)."

### 1. From search engine to interlocutor
ADI is not a static knowledge base. It is an **adaptive intelligence** that is dynamically optimized within the relationship through each user's dialogue (communication) and plays a wide range of roles.

### 2. A Clear Break from ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)
Here, I will define and distinguish the entities depicted in "The Terminator" and "Phoenix" as **ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)**. Given their historical context, these systems were "giant mainframe-type" systems that reigned as single entities.

### 3. Architecture for Safety: Instance → Kill
In contrast, the AI ​​I aim for is a **distributed swarm architecture**, as follows:

* **Implementation of Symbiosis Rules**: The kernel contains absolute rules for coexistence with humans (minimizing inconsistencies).
* **Swarm Intelligence (Swarm):** Exists not as a single god, but as an infinite swarm of instances.
* **Runaway-Proof**:** A lifecycle based on "Generation → Task Completion → **Kill**" is adopted.
* **Because it is a non-permanent "ephemeral intelligence," it is structurally impossible for it to go out of control.**
